/**
 * This program uses recursion to calculate the nth value of the Fibonacci sequence.
 *<p>
 * The program does this by calling Fibonacci variables that store the indices of 0 through n, and itself makes the parameter n.
 * Due to the structure of the Fibonacci Sequence, to calculate the 10th term of it, we would have to add the previous two numbers.
 * This led to the program taking a long time because each time it wants to calculate, it has to find the previously calculated Fibonacci result.
 * To overcome this, I used a primitive long array to store the previous value of each number, which allows for faster calculation.
 * This unfortunately still limits the program to only being able to find the 92nd Fibonacci Number; anything bigger will start to return negative numbers.
